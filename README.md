# Safety
These are the files for implementation of Matlab optimisation programs for p-safety (pSafety.m) and weak p-safety (weakSafetyBenSolve.m). 
The files are associated to the Automatica submission: "Safety of stochastic Systems: An anlytical and Computational Approach".
The code for the p-safety leans upon Theorem 17. The code is explained and demonstrated on a switching diffusion proces in Section 7.
The code for the weak safety lean upon Theorem 24; it is described and illustrated on a diffusion process in Section 9.
